Learning PyQt5

10.01.2018
The complete tutorial page by this site is just amazing
http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/

There are also other options like PyGTK and wxPython, not sure yet as which one is good!!
resource for PyGTK could be https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/unstable/tutorial.py.html.en

PyQT on raspberry PI

https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/31354/qtpy5-on-raspbian-getting-importerror-cannot-import-name-qtcore

Seems like there are licensing issues with pyqt5 for commercial use, alternative is PySide,PyGTK and wxPython looks like both are under LGPL license
https://wiki.qt.io/About_PySide


This https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1094155/developing-guis-in-python-tkinter-vs-pyqt thread talks about pyqt being cross platform and cross language as it has .NET and Jave ports

this should conclude licensing problem

https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1399/can-gpl-licenced-software-be-used-in-corporate-environments

That means, I can continue working with PyQt5! Awesome!!!
