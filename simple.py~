# # Here we provide the necessary imports. The basic widges are located
# # in PyQt5.QtWidgets module.
# import sys
# from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget


# # Every PyQt5 application must create an application object. The
# # sys.argv parameter is a list of arguments from a command
# # line. Python scripts can be run from the shell. It is a way how we
# # can control the startup of our scripts.
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app = QApplication(sys.argv)

# #The QWidget is the base class of all user interface objects in
# #PyQt5. We provide the default constructor for QWidget. The default
# #constructor has no parent. A widget with no parent is called a window.
#     w = QWidget()

# #The resize() method resizes the widget. It is 250px wide and 150px hight.
#     w.resize(250, 150)

# #The move() method moves the widget to a position on the screen at
# #x=300, y=300 coordinates.
#     w.move(300, 300)

# # we set the title of the window with setWindowTitle(). The title is
# # shown in the titlebar
#     w.setWindowTitle('Simple')

# # The show() method displays the widget on the screen. A widget is
# # first created in memory and later shown on the screen.
#     w.show()

# #Finally, we enter the mainloop of the application. The event handling
# #starts from this point. The mainloop receives events from the window
# #system and dispatches them to the application widgets.

# # The mainloop ends if we call the exit() method or the main widget is
# # destroyed. The sys.exit() method ensures a clean exit. The
# # environment will be informed how the application ended.

# # The exec_() method has an underscore. It is because the exec is a
# # python keyword thus exec_() was used instead.

#     sys.exit(app.exec_())
